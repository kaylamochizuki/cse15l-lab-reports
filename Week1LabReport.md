- After downloading, your VScode should appear similarly to the one above


## **PART 2: Remotely Connecting**

Before remotely connecting, you must first change your password for cse15 using this link: [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
After logging into your account, click under “Additional Accounts” the one for cs15l

Now, click on “change your password”
Importance Notes when changing your password:
Once at the password change request, enter your current password which should be the one you use in MyTritionLink
Once you have entered the information, DO NOT press the blue button at the bottom of the page, “Check Password”

If you do not want to change the password you use in MyTritonLink, make sure to switch it to “No”

If you have done the above, position your cursor at the end of your confirm password and click return/enter


Your password change may take 15 minutes to process before you are able to try connecting remotely





To begin Remotely connecting, open a terminal



Type in the command: ssh coursespecific_accountname@ieng.ucsd.edu
Your course specific account name can be found through this link: [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
Under “Additional Accounts” the one for cse15l is your username



		Notes:
If you are prompter with a yes or no question, choose yes
If your password doesn’t work, try again to make sure you typed it in correctly
If you still can’t login and 15 minutes have passed, try using instead of your course specific username, your MyTritonLink username

If you still can’t login after following the instructions above, try waiting a bit more and then change your password again (this is the way I fixed mine the first time)


You will then be prompted to type in your password
This should be the one you just made
When typing in your password it will look like this nothing is happening on your screen, however even though you can’t see it happening, you are typing in your password


## **PART 3: Trying Some Commands**
