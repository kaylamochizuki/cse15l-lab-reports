## Part 2

  Method 1 time: 2 minute 44 seconds
  
  Method 2 time: 2 minute 00 seconds
  
  - Difficulties that came up during the process was that I kept making spelling errors in my command lines that caused me to slow down.
  
 Question 1: Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?
  - I would perfer the second method because I would be starting in the remote server and wouldn't need to keep using scp to move my files from local to remote.
  
 Question 2: What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)
  - If I was working on a really big project with many files and lines, I would choose the first method instead. This is because working locally I wouldn't need to work in the terminal. Though if the project wasn't that big I would choose the second method for convenience of making changes directly in the remote server
